      "image": "/images/scp-001.jpg",
      "shortDescription": "The Scarlet King is an eldritch god formed as the manifestation of the tension between the modern world and the premodern world and the rage it creates. Originally it existing as the concept of there being something greater than man, such as gods or the supernatural, that could not be controlled or reasoned with. The concept was linked into the howling of the wind, and the uncertainty of starvation and famine. This concept was then shaped by the encroachment of modernity into the old world and the clash between the two.",
      "description": "SCP-001 is a designation given to the original object or phenomenon that the SCP Foundation uncovered and verified as the first anomaly requiring Special Containment Procedures."

        "name": "SCP-002: The Living Room",
        "image": "/images/SCP-002.jpg",
        "shortDescription": "SCP-002 resembles a tumorous, fleshy growth with a volume of roughly 60 m³ (or 2000 ft³). An iron valve hatch on one side leads to its interior, which appears to be a standard low-rent apartment of modest size. One wall of the room possesses a single window, though no such opening is visible from the exterior. The room contains furniture which, upon close examination, appears to be sculpted bone, woven hair, and various other biological substances produced by the human body. All matter tested thus far show independent or fragmented DNA sequences for each object in the room.",
        "description": "Contaniment Procedures: SCP-002 is to remain connected to a suitable power supply at all times, to keep it in what appears to be a recharging mode. In case of electrical outage, the emergency barrier between the object and the facility is to be closed and the immediate area evacuated. Once facility power is re-established, alternating bursts of X-ray and ultraviolet light must strobe the area until SCP-002 is re-affixed to the power supply and returned to recharging mode. Containment area is to be kept at negative air pressure at all times. Teams including a minimum of two (2) members are required within 20 meters of SCP-002 or its containment area. Personnel should maintain physical contact with one another at all times to confirm there is another person present, as perception may be dulled, skewed, or influenced by proximity to the object."

        "image": "/images/Scp003.webp",
        "shortDescription": "SCP-003 is to be maintained at a constant temperature of no less than 35°C and ideally kept above 100°C. No living multicellular organisms of Category IV or higher complexity may be allowed to come into contact with SCP-003. In event of total power failure, if SCP-003-1 begins to increase its mass, assigned personnel must engage in skin contact with SCP-003-1. Ideally, personnel may use their body heat to return SCP-003-1 to above the critical temperature; however, skin contact must be maintained even in event of SCP-003 reaching activation temperature, lasting at minimum until SCP-003-1 advances fully to its second growth stage. Personnel who enter SCP-003's containment area must first be examined for body parasites of Category IV or higher complexity, and sterilized if such organisms are present.",
        "description": "SCP-003 consists of two related components of separate origin, referred to as SCP-003-1 and SCP-003-2. SCP-003-1 appears to be composed of chitin, hair, and nails of unknown biology, arranged in a configuration similar to that of a computer motherboard. Testing reveals SCP-003-1 to predate earliest known circuit boards by a factor of thousands of years. SCP-003-1 is considered sentient but not actively dangerous except under certain conditions. SCP-003-1 was found on a stone tablet, SCP-003-2, on which it currently resides. The runes on SCP-003-2 are not part of any known language, and emit pale, flickering light patterns."

        "name": "SCP-004: Twelve Rusty Keys and an Old Wooden Door",
        "image": "/images/Scp004d.jpg",
        "shortDescription": "SCP-004 consists of a SCP-004-1, an old wooden barn door, and SPC-004-2 through SCP-004-13, which are 12 rusty keys. The door should lead to an abandoned factory. The keys all fit into a lock on the door, with most causing immediate dismemberment upon entry except SPC-004-7 and SCP-004-12. In SCP-004-7's case, using that key leads to an impossibly large room of theoretically infinite size. The room was impossible to light or be felt. SCP-004-12, while not immediately dismembering the D-Class that entered, caused the subject so much trauma he was left in a near-catatonic state, eventually needing to be restrained to prevent him from gouging his eyes out.",
        "description": "When handling items SCP-004-2 through SCP-004-13, proper procedure is vital. The items are not permitted to be moved off-site unless accompanied by two Level 4 security personnel. Under no circumstances should any other component of SCP-004 be taken through SCP-004-1. The effects of doing so are as yet unknown, and the current cost of experimentation makes further research impractical."

        "image": "/images/scp-005.jpg",
        "shortDescription": "SCP-005 has been shown to be effective in removing almost any form of locking device, further experiments have shown that efforts to disguise the purpose or identity of a lock have proven at least somewhat successful in defeating SCP-005's ability. In approximately 50% of cases where a volunteer was not able to identify a locking device as such, SCP-005 was not successful in deactivating the device. Due to these results, SCP-005 has been tentatively classified as 'sentient' and further tests are being run to determine its cognitive abilities. However, there are no results that show any traits that prevent it from being able to identify any particular locking device, only that the aforementioned device has been heavily concealed and disguised.",
        "description": "SCP-005 poses no immediate risk in any direct sense. Even so, its unique functions require special measures be taken to restrict access and manipulation of the object. Approval of at least one (1) Level 4 personnel is required for the removal of the object from its containment area."

      "image": "/images/scp173.jpg",
      "shortDescription": "SCP–173 is classified by the organization as a “Euclid”, as it's containment procedures are more complex than those of SCPs classed under 'Safe', but unlike with SCPs classed under 'Keter' if containment procedures are correctly implemented and followed they can't breach containment. Item SCP-173 is to be kept in a locked container at all times. When personnel must enter SCP-173's container, no fewer than 3 may enter at any time and the door is to be relocked behind them. At all times, two persons must maintain direct eye contact with SCP-173 until all personnel have vacated and relocked the container. Item SCP-173 is to be kept in a locked containment room at all times.",
      "description": "SCP–173 is a 2 meters tall (6ft) concrete statue with bizarre markings that kills all living things on sight, moving toward its victims at a speed of several feet in one blink of an eye and snapping their necks with irresistible strength and lethal precision. In addition, it's completely invincible. It also periodically produces feces and blood onto the ground of its containment cell, which must be cleaned up from time to time."
